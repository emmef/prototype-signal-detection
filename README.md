# Prototypes for signal detection algorithms using Octave

Especially in audio, signal processing often needs to &ldquo;detect&rdquo; signals, for example to measure peak values or vague concepts like &ldquo;perceived  loudnes.&rdquo;. An example is the [simple-dsp](https://github.com/emmef/simple-dsp) project. Because of nasty environments or the sheer amounts of data involved, it is hard to tell if a detection behaves correctly. This project aims to propotype these algorithms, to make sure they behave as expected. Once the algorithm is approved, it can be ported to the specific project.
